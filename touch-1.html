        <p>We just had a big win with Habbot, an eCom store like yours got a 8.32x return on ad spend. We spent $16,232.58 on FB ads, and made them $135,055.</p>
        <p>Based on what you've got on your store, I think I could do something similar.</p>
        <p>Would it be a terrible idea to grab some time on calendar for a quick Zoom call?</p>
